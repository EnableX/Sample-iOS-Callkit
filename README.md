# A Sample iOS App with EnableX iOS Toolkit and Callkit 

This iOS Sample App, demonstrates how to integrate the CallKit (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit) 
with EnableX (https://www.enablex.io) platform using iOS Toolkit.

### Note: To try out this code, youâ€™ll need an iPhone with iOS 12.0 or higher
**Note: CallKit is not supported in Simulator* 

### What is CallKit?
CallKit is a framework that aims to improve the VoIP experience by allowing applications to integrate with the native phone UI. 
By adopting CallKit, your app will be able to Use the native incoming call screen in both the locked and unlocked states.

## Installation and pre-requisites:

### Use CocoaPods to install the project files and dependencies.

1. Install CocoaPods as described in [CocoaPods Getting Started](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).
1.1 In Terminal, `cd` to your project directory and type `pod install`.
1.2  Reopen your project in Xcode using the new `*.xcworkspace` file.

### Configure and build the app

Configure the sample app code, Then, build and run the app.

2. The application **requires** values for **RoomId**.
        1.1 Replace the following empty strings with the corresponding **room_Id** values in `AppDelegate.swift`:
                        ```swift
                        let room_Id = ""
                        ```
3. Use Xcode to build and run the app on an iOS simulator or device.

### Exploring the sample app

4 **Call Triger**: 

![home](./home.png)

The iOS system boosts the call priority of the app. Then, the app starts publishing to EnableX platform. You will not notice any differences until you go to the home screen.
  - An incoming native phone call will not interrupt the current VoIP call, instead it shows the option menu.
  - App will show native incoming call UI to answer the call.

 **Incoming call lock Screen**

 **Recive call lock Screen**

   ** use a push server or [NWPusher](https://github.com/noodlewerk/NWPusher) to call**

This requires a few more steps:

    - create your certificate
    - configure your push notification backend or NWPusher
    - locate your device token for testing (launch the app and get it from the console)
    - send a remote notification from your backend or NWPusher


## Exploring the code
**CXProvider**
        CXProvider is an object which is responsible for report any out-of-band notifications to the system.
        To initialize the provider with the appropriate `CXProviderConfiguration` object, A provider configuration specifies the behavior and capabilities of the calls, To pass on the `CXProvider` initializer. In order to receive telephony events of the provider, the provider needs to specify an object conforming to the `CXProviderDelegate` protocol.

```swift
// create a provider 
    let providerConfiguration = CXProviderConfiguration(localizedName: "EnxCall")
    providerConfiguration.supportsVideo = false
    providerConfiguration.maximumCallsPerCallGroup = 1
    providerConfiguration.supportedHandleTypes = [.phoneNumber]
    providerConfiguration.ringtoneSound = "callTone.caf"

// set up a provider
    provider = CXProvider(configuration: type(of: self).providerConfiguration)
    provider.setDelegate(self as? CXProviderDelegate, queue: nil)
```

The `CXProviderDelegate` protocol defines events of the telephony provider (`CXProvider`) such as the call starting, the call being put on hold , end Call and andwer call.

```swift
// MARK: Provider Delegates
func providerDidReset(_ provider: CXProvider) {
    for call in callManager.calls{
    call.endCall()
    }
    callManager.removeAllCalls()
}

func provider(_ provider: CXProvider, perform action: CXStartCallAction) {
    print("To start a call action")
}

func provider(_ provider: CXProvider, perform action: CXAnswerCallAction) {
    print("Answer incoming call action")
}

func provider(_ provider: CXProvider, perform action: CXEndCallAction) {
    print("End call action")
}

func provider(_ provider: CXProvider, perform action: CXSetHeldCallAction) {
    print("Hold call action")
}

func provider(_ provider: CXProvider, perform action: CXSetMutedCallAction) {
    print("Mute call action")
}
``` 

The following methods indicate whether your VoIP call has been successfully priority boosted or recovered.

```swift
func provider(_ provider: CXProvider, timedOutPerforming action: CXAction) {
   print("Timed out Action")
    // React to the action timeout if necessary, such as showing an error UI.
}

func provider(_ provider: CXProvider, didActivate audioSession: AVAudioSession) {
    // Start call audio media, now that the audio session has been activated after having its priority boosted.
}

func provider(_ provider: CXProvider, didDeactivate audioSession: AVAudioSession) {
    /*
        Restart any non-call related audio now that the app's audio session has been
        de-activated after having its priority restored to normal.
    */
}
```

**CXCallController** 
`CXCallController` is responsible to inform the system of user-initiated requests, such as a Start call action. This is the key difference between the CXProvider and the CXCallController: The provider reports to the system whereas the call controller makes requests from the system on behalf of the user.

The call controller uses `CXTransaction` object  to request a telephony action (which will later trigger delegate methods above if succeed).Each telephony action has a corresponding `CXAction` class such as `CXEndCallAction` for ending a call, `CXSetHeldCallAction` for setting a call on hold.

Once you have it all ready, invoke the `request(_:completion:)` by passing a ready transaction object. Here's how you start a call:

```swift
// create a CXAction
let handle = CXHandle(type: .phoneNumber, value: handle)
let startCall = CXStartCallAction(call: UUID(), handle: handle): handle))


// create a transaction
let callTransaction = CXTransaction()
callTransaction.addAction(startCall)

// create a label
let action = "startCall"

    callContr.request(callTrans){ error in
    if let error = error {
        print("Error requesting transaction: \(error)")
        } else {
        print("Requested transaction \(action) successfully")
        }
        }

```

As for answering a call, the `CallKit` framework provides a convenient API to present a native call UI. By invoking `reportNewIncomingCall(with:update:completion:)` on the provider, you will have the same experience as receiving a native phone call. Often, this piece of code works with VoIP remote notification to make calls to a device/person same like native call UI experience.

```swift
// Construct a CXCallUpdate describing the incoming call, including the caller.
    let update = CXCallUpdate()
update.remoteHandle = CXHandle(type: .phoneNumber, value: handle)

// Report the incoming call to the system
    provider.reportNewIncomingCall(with: uuid, update: update) { error in
    /*
      Only add incoming call to the app's list of calls if the call was allowed (i.e. there was no error)
      since calls may be "denied" for various legitimate reasons. See CXErrorCodeIncomingCallError.
    */
}
```
